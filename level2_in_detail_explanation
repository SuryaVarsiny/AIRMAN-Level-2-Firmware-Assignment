STEP 1 — Development Environment Setup
VS Code was used as the code editor to write and manage all C and Python files.
MSYS2 MinGW64 terminal was used to compile C programs using gcc.
PowerShell (inside VS Code) was used to run Python scripts and display plots.
Python 3 with matplotlib was installed for real-time visualization.

Why two terminals?

MSYS2 → best for compiling C (gcc)
PowerShell → best for running Python GUI plots on Windows

STEP 2 — Simulated Sensor Data (C Program)
Instead of real hardware, IMU data was simulated:
Accelerometer → sine/cosine motion
Gyroscope → slowly changing angular rates
Magnetometer → fixed reference direction
Altitude and temperature → predictable variation
This guarantees stable and repeatable inputs for the AHRS filter.

STEP 3 — AHRS Algorithm (Complementary Filter)
A Complementary Filter was implemented in ahrs.c:
Gyroscope data provides short-term accuracy
Accelerometer & magnetometer provide long-term stability

Outputs:
Roll
Pitch
Heading (Yaw)
This filter is computationally light and suitable for embedded firmware.

STEP 4 — Enhanced Level 2 Telemetry Frame
The transmitter formats AHRS outputs into a Level 2 frame:
$L2,<timestamp>,<roll>,<pitch>,<heading>,<alt>,<temp>*<CHK>
Frames are sent every 50 ms (20 Hz)
XOR checksum ensures data integrity
Output is printed to stdout (UART simulation)

STEP 5 — Compiling Level 2 Transmitter (MSYS2)
In MSYS2 MinGW64 terminal:
gcc telemetry_tx2.c ahrs.c -lm -o telemetry_tx2.exe
This produces a Windows executable that continuously outputs Level 2 telemetry frames.

STEP 6 — Python Real-Time Plot Script
The Python script plot_live.py:
Reads telemetry lines from standard input
Parses roll, pitch, and heading
Updates plots at ≥10 Hz using matplotlib
Uses the TkAgg backend for Windows GUI support

STEP 7 — Running the Full Pipeline (PowerShell)
In VS Code PowerShell terminal:
.\telemetry_tx2.exe | python plot_live.py

What happens:
C program generates AHRS telemetry
Output is piped to Python
Python parses data
Live plot window opens
Roll, pitch, and heading update in real time

STEP 8 — Plot Appearance
A matplotlib window opens automatically
Three curves are displayed:
Roll
Pitch
Heading
The plot updates continuously (real-time)
Closing the window or pressing Ctrl+C stops execution

STEP 9 — Demo Video Recording
The running plot window and terminal output were recorded
Duration: 20–40 seconds
Demonstrates:
Live AHRS computation
Stable telemetry
Real-time visualization

STEP 10 — Key Assumptions & Simplifications
No real IMU hardware (simulated data)
UART communication simulated via stdout/stdin
Complementary filter used instead of Madgwick for simplicity

Focus on correctness and clarity over optimization
